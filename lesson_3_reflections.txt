When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

--i would use forks when i want to advance in some project from another person that interest me and i want to do my own modifications and collaborate with that person
--i would use clone to simply have the program someone has done
--i would do branches on my project when i want to do experimental modifications
